Docker:
Docker is a containization platform which is used for running process or application or isolated units in user works space.
It is the next step in virtualization.
Virtualization 
In Virtualization we have a bare metal (Hardware) on which we install the host operating system on this we install the hypervisor
software like VM ware/oracle/virtual box etc on the hypervisor we install guset OS.On OS we can install the application that we require.
These application have to communicate with multple layers in order to access the Hardware resources.















Docker solves this problem by using containers.Containers occupy very less space and memory>And they can be created in matter of seconds. Containers 
care mostly useful in implementing micro services.


















Docker uses a layer called docker engine which is directly installed on host OS.This Docker engine has the capacity of spinning multiple docker containers
as individual process.The docker engine also takes care of the hardware resource allocation between the docker containners.
